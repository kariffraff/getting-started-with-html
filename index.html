<title>Greetings</title>  
  <body>
  <b>Aloha!</b>
  <br>
  <br> 
  I live in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I really love the weather here, it is beautiful all of the time! 
  <br>
  <br>Not to mention, you can swim in the ocean year-round!  <br>
  <br>
I'd like to take the opportunity 
  to share some pictures of the beautiful 
  scenery taken by one of my 
  <em>favorite </em>local photographers. 

<p>His name is Clark Little:</p>

Introduction to Computer Programming - Udacity nanodegree: 
<br>Week 1:
<br>scratchpad.io
<br>codepen.io
<br>
<br>-Procedural Thinking
<br>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.
<br>-Abstract Thinking
<br>Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.
<br>-Systematic Debugging
<br>Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.
<br>-Technological Empathy
<br>Understand the computer as a tool.
<br>*Systems Thinking*-all of the above
<br>Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.
<br>
<br>
This Nanodegree is...
<br>Organized around a single project: a webpage that will also be your notes for the Nanodegree.
<br>The project will be broken into 5 stages.
<br>Each stage has a course associated with it.
<br>Each course is a collage of content sampled from a variety of classes taught by professional programmers, tech company creators, and university professors.
<br>I will help you focus on the most important concepts by providing context and occasionally filling in gaps.

<br>Basics of the Web and HTML
<br>-world wide web-made up of lots of HTML documents
<br>-HTML-hypertext markup language (glue)
<br>-major pieces of web-you,computer(browser),Internet,http,servers
<br>HTTP-main protocol of the web
<br>Servers-computers that host the files that make up the web
<br>Internet-the world's largest computer network
<br>Browser-a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web.

<br>HTML docs-the heart of the web, made up of:
<br>Text content
<br>Markup (appearance)
<br>References to other documents
<br>Links to other pages

<br>HTML markup-tags (opening/closing), element (phrase)
<br><b> bold </b>
<br><em> italic </em>
<br>
<br>
HTML Attributes
<br><TAG ATTR="value"></TAG> anchor a-anchors are for making links
<br><a href="www.reddit.com">derp</a>
<br>Images-<img>
<br><img src="url" alt="text"> 
<br>A Void tag-does not have content and therefore does not need a closing tag, alt is for broken requests/blind ppl
<br>line 
break (likw enter)-void tag
<p></p> paragraph-line break
<br>
<br>Whitespace
<br>
<br>Inline vs. block 
<br>Inline elements
<br>Block elements--create 'invisible boxes'
<br> -inline
<p>-block
<br>
<br>Container elements-elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside them
<br><span> inline
<br><div> block
<span class="foo"></span>
<div class="bar"></span>
<br>CSS-class--a separate language to add styles to docs or controlling how text looks (also JavaScript)
<br>
<br>1 - What a Web Page is
<br>
<br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
<br>
<br>2 - How Coding Works
<br>
<br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
<br>
<br>I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
<br>
<br>look like this:
<br>
<br>I'm learning to code!
<br>
<br>3 - Computers are Stupid
<br>
<br>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
<br>
<br>For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.</b>
<br>
<br>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything
<br>
<br>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
<br>
<br>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary
<br>
<br>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<br>
<br>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<b> for example) and a closing tag, (</b>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <br> tag).
<br>
<br>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>
<br>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com">
